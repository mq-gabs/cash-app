# CASH APP

## What is it?
This is an web app designed to run localy. It is beeing made for someone who can't afford a web deployment. This person requested this system to help with his small business. So I decided to develop this version to be used as an desktop app but executed in browser.

## What is this made of?
I decided to use [Golang](https://go.dev/) to make a compiled app to be easely executed.

### Backend
  I'm using [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) for server and [Gorm](https://gorm.io/) to manage database which is SQLite.

### Frontend
  I'm using [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) with [Vite](https://vite.dev/) as a development tool. For styling [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
